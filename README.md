<p>I like reading books because they are really cool. The reason they are really cool is because 
they can be very captivating. I normally prefer to read fiction as I feel that it is not only
more fun to read but can also broaden the imagination. My favorite genre is comedy books, but 
I mostly try to vary the genres that I read. Reading really helps me to relax at the end of 
the day.</p>

<h3>Here's a link to my favorite book:</h3>

<h2><i>More about art:</i></h2>

<p>I think art is really cool. You can make like almost anything you can think about by using
art. It can help you to express yourself. It also can improve your mood. It helps me to be 
more creative as it can help improve your imagination. Those are all the main reasons that 
I enjoy doing it.</p>

<p>I try to practice my art skills at least once every day. Below is a table which shows at 
what times I generally like to practice at each day: </p>

<P>When I get home, I sometimes like to play games. I play a lot of differnet games but my favorite
game is called "hollow knight". It is very fun and I really like playing it as it is very well 
made. It helps me to unwind at the end of the day.</p>
<h3>Here is an image of the player character:</h3>
